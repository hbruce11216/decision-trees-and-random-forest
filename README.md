# decision-trees-and-xgboost
The goal of this exploration (using a Carseats Sales dataset) is to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable. Then I attempt to implement XGBoost on an unbalanced (Caravan.csv) dataset.

Check out the two .ipynb files to see my work in exploring this topic!
